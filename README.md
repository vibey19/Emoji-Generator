# üòÉ Facial Emotion Recognition using OpenCV and DeepFace

This project enables real-time facial emotion detection using the `DeepFace` library and OpenCV. It captures video from your webcam, detects faces, and identifies their emotions. Emotions are displayed as both text labels and emoji overlays on the video frames.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- **Real-time face detection**: Utilizes Haar cascades for efficient face detection.
- **Emotion analysis**: Leverages `DeepFace` for deep learning-based emotion recognition.
- **Emoji overlay**: Displays corresponding emojis for detected emotions alongside text labels.
- **Interactive UI**: A side-by-side view of emoji overlay and text-based emotion labeling.

## üîó Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface): Deep learning library for facial analysis.
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): For video capture and image processing.

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or install individually:
```bash
pip install deepface
pip install tf_keras
pip install opencv-python
```

## üî¨ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manish-9245/Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-Deepface.git
   cd Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-Deepface
   ```

2. **Download Haar Cascade XML file:**
   - Obtain `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` from the [OpenCV GitHub repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).
   - Place it in the project directory.

3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python emotion_recognition.py
   ```

4. **Output:**
   - Webcam will open.
   - Detected emotions will be displayed as text and emojis.
   - Press **`q`** to exit.

## üîé How It Works

1. **Face Detection:**
   - Uses Haar cascades to identify faces in the video feed.
2. **Emotion Prediction:**
   - Processes detected faces using `DeepFace` to predict emotions.
3. **Emoji Overlay:**
   - Maps predicted emotions to emojis and overlays them on the frame.
4. **Real-time Display:**
   - Frames are updated continuously to show results in real time.

## üîç Code Overview

### Core Features:

1. **Libraries Used:**
   ```python
   import cv2
   from deepface import DeepFace
   ```

2. **Emoji Integration:**
   Emojis are loaded as image files and resized to match face dimensions.

3. **Overlay Function:**
   Adds emoji overlays with transparency using:
   ```python
   def overlay_image_alpha(img, img_overlay, x, y, alpha_mask):
       # Blend overlay within the determined region
       ...
   ```

4. **Loop for Real-time Processing:**
   - Captures video frames.
   - Detects faces and predicts emotions.
   - Displays results with text and emoji overlays.

## üí° Tips
- Ensure adequate lighting for better face detection.
- Test with different emotions for robust results.
- Experiment with different Haar cascade files for improved performance.
